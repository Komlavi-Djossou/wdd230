        <h1>PERSONAS</h1>
        <h2>PESRSONA ONE</h2>
        <P>Kwajo, a hardworking farmer with a wife and five children has seen a lot of his crops
            gotten spoilt due to the lack of rainfall. He has lost plenty money because of that and prays
            that he finds a way of knowing the weather ahead so he knows what to plant.
        </P>
        <h2>PESRSONA TWO</h2>
        <P>Amina sells rice across the street. She loses a lot money any day it rains because
            people don't normally come to buy when it rains. She would like to know a way of predicting the weather so she knows
            how much to invest in cooking, that will permit her not not to waist money in cooking plenty food.
        </P>
        <h1>SCENARIOS</h1>
        <h2>SCENARIO 1</h2>
        <P>Kwajo has planned to sow maize in the upcoming months. He has
            cultivated the land and prepared everything to sow maize on that day.
            Luckily, a week ago before the exact day. He recieves a message from Check Weather on his phone
            informing him that there won't be rain throughout the next three months.
            So he has planned for water delivery people who had come to water his crops the 
            entire season. This has helped him to harvest enough maize to sell and gain
            interest. 
        </P>
        <h2>SCENARIO 2</h2>
        <P>Amina cooks three bags of rice everyday which she sells completely.
            Tomorrow she has planned to do so, but early this morning Check Weather sent her
            a notification that there will be heavy rain the entire day tomorrow.
            So she is cooking only one bag of rice for tomorrow. In case people
            come out to buy in abundance, she will cook additional rice.
        </P>
        <h2>SCENARIO 3</h2>
        <P>Two days ago, Abel was beaten by rain as he was going to visit his mother in a 
            different town. Today he was informed that it will rain but around 3pm to 5pm. 
            So he travelled back home early before the rain started.
        </P>
        <h2>SCENARIO 4</h2>
        <P>Judith had planned to have her marriage party today. People informed him that since they don't 
            know when the rain will stop, they are not sure of when they would arrive. Then she checks the information on
            Chek Weather and she got to know that it will be sunny around 3pm. she then
            informed his friends that the party has been prosponed to
            3pm. She has also informed restaurant people to come with food she commanded at that time.
            At the end of the day, the party has been held and everything was successful.
        </P>
        <h2>SCENARIO 5</h2>
        <P>Astra International School had planned the award winning ceremony at the beach place last year
            but because it rained parents, students and friends failed to 
            come in abundance. Due to that, the school has wasted money on food and other things.
            This year the school is happy because they have chosen a day on which unexpected 
            rain has not come. They are happy because Check Weather has helped them plan the event.
