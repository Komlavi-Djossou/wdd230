        <p>
            A lot of people living in Africa, usually plan activities and those activities had not been successful
            because of unexpecteed rain, or we planned to travel on a specific day but we could not because, it rained. 
            Have you once found yourself in any of this situation? Didn't you feel that 
            if you had known the weather ahead of time it would have helped?
            
            The objective of the Check Weather website is help people to know ahead of time what the weather will be like.
            Being aware of the weather days before an event will help travelers, farmers and 
            women that sell across the street to plan how their activities will be on that specific day.
            
            People who will sign up to the website will be receiving notifications on their phones or laptops and
            trhough email. This will prevent a lot of unsuccessful activites and farmers will
            know how to go about their activities effectively everyday.
